# turntable-gif
Turntable model made using simple 3D shapes, copied a few times and animated. The animation is calculated to loop perfectly after 400 frames. To make a video from this sketch, I've captured first 400 frames using saveFrame() function and converted them to .gif using some online converter. Gif as well as the animation itself runs at 50fps.
